        With their warm sand and gentle waves, beaches have a soothing ambiance that nothing can beat. There's simply no better place to let go of daily stress than on the beach. You can sit back and soak up the sun, watch the waves roll in, or even take a nap in a hammock strung between two palm trees.

        Kids are drawn to water and can learn from playing in it. The beach provides a unique environment for them to explore and have many different types of learning experiences.
